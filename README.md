# Implementation-of-various-MIS-Algorithms

<p>Implementation of five Maximal Independent Set (MIS) Distributed Algorithms in NetLogo and testing them on a network of nodes.
We want to measure the number of rounds, the amount of messages and bits that each algorithm needs. The algorithms consist of:</p>

1. Luby's MIS Distributed Algorithm
2. Biologically-Inspired Distributed MIS Algorithm
3. Optimal Distributed MIS Algorithm
4. Randomized MIS Algorithm
5. Deterministic MIS Algorithm
